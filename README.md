# ENHANCING-UNDERWATER-RESOURCES-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Enhancing Underwater Resources Using Deep Learning
A Final Year Major Project | B.Tech CSE – Data Science | JNTUH (2024–2025)

This project presents a deep learning-based solution to improve the quality of underwater images, which are often degraded due to light absorption, scattering, and turbidity. We developed a novel Multi-Patch Residual Attention Network (MP-RAN) designed to enhance underwater images through advanced deep learning techniques. The model combines multi-patch processing, residual attention mechanisms, and multi-scale learning to effectively address common challenges such as low contrast, color distortion, and blurriness.

Using the UIEB dataset (890 raw and reference underwater image pairs), the system achieved strong performance metrics with a PSNR of 23% and SSIM of 86%, confirming its efficiency in restoring visibility and structural integrity in underwater visuals.
